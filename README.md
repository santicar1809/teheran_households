# Clustering and Prediction of Properties in Teheran

## Project Description

This project focuses on clustering and predicting property prices in Teheran using a dataset of property features. The workflow involves preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), clustering, and regression modeling. Below are the detailed steps:

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Cleaning**:
  - Verify the dataset for missing (NaN) values and duplicate entries.
  - Handle missing values by either dropping rows/columns or imputing them appropriately.
  - Remove duplicates to ensure data consistency.
  
- **Type Verification**:
  - Check the data types of all columns to ensure compatibility for modeling.
  - Identify and address outliers that may impact the analysis.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conduct in-depth analysis to uncover insights within the dataset.
- Focus on the relationships between property features and their correlation with the target variable (price).
- Visualize distributions and relationships between variables to understand the data better.

### 3. Feature Engineering for Clustering

- Normalize the data to standardize features for clustering algorithms.
- Use visualization techniques (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) to simplify the representation of clusters.

### 4. Clustering

- Apply unsupervised learning algorithms:
  - **K-Means**: Determine optimal cluster count using the elbow method and silhouette score.
  - **DBSCAN**: Identify clusters with varying densities.
  - **Hierarchical Clustering**: Visualize relationships using a dendrogram.

### 5. Feature Engineering for Regression

- Encode categorical data into numeric format to make it compatible with regression algorithms.
- Ensure all features are scaled and transformed appropriately for regression tasks.

### 6. Regression Modeling

- **Data Preparation**:
  - Separate the target variable (price) from the features.
  - Use pipelines to automate scaling and model training.

- **Algorithms Used**:
  - LightGBM
  - CatBoost
  - XGBoost
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Linear Regression
  - Neural Network

- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Compare model performance using metrics such as:
    - RÂ² Score
    - Mean Squared Error (MSE)

### 7. Model Testing

- Evaluate models on a test dataset to assess their generalization performance.
- Compare the results across different models to determine the best-performing algorithm.
